How can I enable the Enterprise Hub with my AWS account?

### 1. Getting Started

Before you can connect your AWS Account with your Hugging Face account, you need to fulfill the following prerequisites: 

- Have access to an active AWS account with access to subscribe to products on the AWS Marketplace.
- Create a [Hugging Face organization account](https://huggingface.co/organizations/new) with a registered and confirmed email. (You cannot connect user accounts)
- Be a member of the Hugging Face organization you want to connect with the [‚Äúadmin‚Äù role](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/organizations-security).
- Logged into the Hugging Face Platform.

Once you meet these requirements, you can proceed with connecting your AWS and Hugging Face accounts.

### 2. Connect your Hugging Face Account with your AWS Account

The first step is to go to the [AWS Marketplace offering](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-n6vsyhdjkfng2) and subscribe to the Hugging Face Platform. There you open the [offer](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-n6vsyhdjkfng2) and then click on ‚ÄúView purchase options‚Äù at the top right screen.
